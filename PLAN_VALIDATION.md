The plan involves two main components:

1. pong.py: This file contains the core implementation of the Pong game using the pygame library. It handles game initialization, user input, game state updates, and rendering of game objects on the screen.

2. cli.py: This file provides a command-line interface using the Typer library. It imports the game logic from pong.py and allows users to start the Pong game from the command line.

This architecture is viable as it separates the game logic from the command-line interface, promoting modularity and ease of maintenance.
